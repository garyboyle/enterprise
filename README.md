# Enterprise

Things I think an enterprise app should have

## Node Version

[Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is used to manage mulitple globally installed Node verions. Use .nvmrc to define the node version for a project. Then run `nvm use` to use this defined verions. Or set up [NVM shell integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#deeper-shell-integration) so that NVM will automatically download and use the defined verion.
